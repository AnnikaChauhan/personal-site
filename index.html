                    <h3>My Journey into Software Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        For a long time I've thought about how cool it would be to know how to code, however as
                        a young Asian lady it is much harder to choose to do something that is completely
                        "unknown". I remember picking up a book about C++ when I was younger and wanting
                        to experiment with the code, but being far too afraid that I'd break the computer to
                        try!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My first experience of programming was in my first full time job as a Finance Assistant.
                        I was using Excel and thinking about how to best use a macro to automate a task. I googled for
                        hours and found all of these fantastic
                        codes that could do so many things beyond a simple spreadsheet - you could even create
                        emails! And so I fell down the rabbit hole, I googled and I coded. Then I started to
                        pick up lots of new skills that could be applied to my job and to the jobs of those around me, I
                        was kind of like a problem solver and I loved it!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I started my second job a year and a half after the first. As a Data
                        Analyst I had far more flexibility in producing systems that pushed the limit of
                        what Excel could do and I had many more problems to solve. I realised that I really
                        did enjoy making things rather than analysing the data, and so I started to learn coding
                        using Codecademy on their Web Development path. The more I learnt, the more I enjoyed
                        and so I decided that the next logical step would be to pursue
                        it as a full time career.

                    <h3>My Journey alongside Software Development</h3>
                    <p>Since my roles were always based around logic and numbers, I like to use my free time to express
                        my creativity. Some of my favourite things to do include painting and photography, mainly
                        abstracts and textures. Last winter, I volunteered as a costume designer and make up artist for
                        a Christmas pantomime. I also like to learn new things and improve myself as best posssible, I
                        find that reading books across a variety of genres gives me that opportunity.</p>
