# personal-site

This repository is directly connected to the URL annikachauhan.com.

Access to the site is available [here](https://annikachauhan.com/)

The repo and domain are for my "portfolio site" which is a site introducing myself and my skills. Contained in it are links to some of my favourite projects. 

This repo is a very simple one and the site is made up of a html, css and js files. Preprocessor of SASS has also been added.

The projects have been rendered to the page using a JavaScript Class and a data file. To add additional projects they can be added to the data.js file, including all of the relevant key-value pairs in the other objects for the render to be successful.
